<p>Moventu is an app born from the necessity to encourage users to GO OUT, making them feel the motivation to explore and discover new locations around them.</p>

<p>It serves a random loop route based on location and desired activity distance, and guides the user one step at a time, without revealing the full route or directions.</p>
